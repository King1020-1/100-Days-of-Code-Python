# Day 20 & 21 - Snake Game Project

This is my Day 20 & 21 Project

---

## Description

The task is to create a classic Snake game using the `turtle` module.
The player controls the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls or itself.

**Solution URL:** [Snake Game](snake-game/main.py)

## Learnings

1. Practiced using the `turtle` module for advanced graphics and animation.
2. Implemented keyboard controls and event listeners for real-time gameplay.
3. Managed game state, collision detection, and score tracking.
4. Worked with custom images and shapes for enhanced visuals.
5. Improved code organization by using classes for the snake, food, and scoreboard.

## Known bugs

1. Pressing buttons too fast within 0.15 seconds might make you lose automatically
2. If you try to turn towards a direction where it is a wall or body you will get game over screen without the snake's head updating to that direction.

If anyone can fix these please make a pull request after fixing it.
