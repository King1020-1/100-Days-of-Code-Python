# Day 6 â€“ Escaping the Maze

This is my Day 6 Project  
This project is unique compared to previous ones as, it solves the Maze Challenge in Reeborgs World.  

---

## Description
  
The goal is to instruct the robot in Reeborg's World to escape from a maze.  
You can try the challenge yourself here:  
[Maze Challenge](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json)
  
**Note:**  
My current solution may not work for all maze configurations and could result in an infinite loop in some cases. I plan to improve the solution as I progress further in the course.  
**Solution URL:** [Escaping the Maze](main.py)
