## Learnings

1. Used multiple functions to keep the code maintainable and simple.
2. Learned how the `and` and `or` operators work in Python:
   - `and` returns the first False value or the last True value.
   - `or` returns the first True value or the last False value.

   I used this behavior to first check for resources, and only call the money function if resources were sufficient. If the resource check failed, the program would not ask for money.
