# Day 13 - 2048 Game

The course didn’t provide a project for Day 13, so I created my own!  
Today’s lesson was focused on debugging and fixing code.

## Description

A terminal based 2048 game  
**Solution URL:** [2048 Game](main.py)

## Debugging Techniques

1. Understanding what the code actually does
2. "Playing Computer" and working through the logic manually
3. Reproducing Errors (If you can't reliably reproduce an error you can't fix it)
4. Using the Builtin Debugging tools in IDEs
5. Taking breaks or asking someone else for help,what’s unclear to you might be obvious to others

## Learnings

1. Values like `0`, `[]`, `{}`, `()`, and `""` are considered Falsy in Python (`bool()` returns `False`) while all other values are considered Truthy (`bool()` returns `True`)
2. Opening and Closing `.json` files and using `json.loads` and `json.dumps`
3. Using `divmod()` to get both the quotient and remainder of a number
