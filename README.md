## Author's Note

Many of these projects are simple or experimental, and Iâ€™m not fully satisfied with all of them. I plan to revisit and improve some projects over time.  

If you find any bugs or issues, feel free to fork
the repository and submit a fix!

**NOTE:** The complexity of the projects might not be strictly linear, as I have improved or expanded some projects after their initial completion.

Thank you for checking this out , I hope you learnt something from this.  
Happy coding and learning!
